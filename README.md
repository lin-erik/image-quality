## Available Scripts

In `/app`, you can run `npm start` to start up the frontend.<br />
In `/api`, you can run `python app.py` to start up the backend.

## Starting Out

Python should be installed, preferably Python 3.<br />

In `/api`, run `source bin/activate` -- this will load you into Python `venv` ie virtual environment.<br />
Once in the virtual environment, run `pip install requirements.txt` -- this should install all dependencies required to run the API.<br />
If you ever need to leave the virtual environment, simply run `deactivate`

In `/app`, run `npm install` -- this should install all dependencies.
